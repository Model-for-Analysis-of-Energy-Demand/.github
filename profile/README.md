# Model for Analysis of Energy Demand

The Model for the Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED) was developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and evaluates future energy demands (final and useful) based on medium to long term scenarios of socioeconomic, technological, and demographic development. Energy demand is disaggregated into a large number of end-use categories corresponding to different goods and services. MAED can be configured to reflect the economic structure of the sub-national or national case study in question.

The MAED organisation consists of the following repositories:
* [MAED-UI](https://github.com/Model-for-Analysis-of-Energy-Demand/MAED-UI): contains the installation file for the MAED User Interface (UI) and instructions for how to install other necessary software.
* [MAED-Code](https://github.com/Model-for-Analysis-of-Energy-Demand/MAED-Code): contains the code used to run the model through the UI.
* [MAED-Projects](https://github.com/Model-for-Analysis-of-Energy-Demand/MAED-Projects): contains model files for peer-reviewed published MAED case studies.

## Other Resources

* [Community Forum](https://forum.u4ria.org/c/maed/13): a forum dedicated to MAED where users can ask questions regarding the tool and engage with experts worldwide. The forum also contains pages for a range of other open-source tools including OSeMOSYS, OnSSET, OnSTOVE, FINPLAN, NISMOD, and CLEWs.
* [Documentation](https://www.iaea.org/publications/7430/model-for-analysis-of-energy-demand-maed-2): the documentation for the tool including the logic behind both modules (MAED-D and -EL) and the associated equations.
* [Literature Review Database](https://zenodo.org/records/15928712): the database associated with the literature review 'A systematic literature review of studies using the IAEA Model for Analysis of Energy Demand (MAED)', presenting all the papers included in the analysis and key information including objectives, key results, sectoral coverage, and data availability among others.
